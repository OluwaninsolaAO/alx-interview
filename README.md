# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

Technical questions in the tech industry are important as they assess a
candidate's knowledge, skills, and problem-solving abilities. They
validate competency, determine adaptability, and evaluate communication
and collaboration skills. By asking technical questions, employers can
make informed hiring decisions, reduce risks, and ensure a cultural
fit within their teams.

### Task

of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n`:

+ Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
+ You can assume `n` will be always an integer
